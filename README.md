Springboard Data Science Track Unit 4.3 Case Study - London Housing Costs

Using housing data from the London DataStore, evaluate how housing index prices have changed in the 32 boroughs of London since the mid-1990's. 
For this particular assignment, find the borough which has seen the greatest price increase from 1998 to 2018. 
The price_ratio function will accept any year pair from the data, for those curious to explore further.
